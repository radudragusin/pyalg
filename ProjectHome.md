This project aims to develop an algorithm learning platform that contains an extensive library of algorithms for Python and provides their visualization and benchmarking capabilities. Also provided will be a module for assessing the computational complexity using a Pythton code line tracer.

The final project will consist of three main components:
  * A library in Python of algorithms and data structures
  * A complexity analyzer for algorithms and data structures
  * A visualizer of the algorithms and data structures (through project vispy) - not yet!

The project can be used in bachelor level courses on algorithms and data structures.

Alpha version was released (May 2010). You can run the program by downloading the files and running:
`python pyalg.py`
from your local copy.
