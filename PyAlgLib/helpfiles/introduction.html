<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is PyAlg</span><br>
<br>
PyAlg is an application mainly targeted to students studying or
following a course on algorithms and data structures. It can be used as
a learning platform in the lectures or in self study. Its main feature
is providing a simple way of benchmarking algorithms written in Python.<br>
<br>
It was originally designed for the students following the bachelor
level course on Algorithms and Data Structures from the Department of
Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Functionality</span><br>
<br>
Some basic features of the application:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Benchmark algorithms</li>
  <li>Compare algorithms' running time and line count</li>
  <li>Visualize the flow of an algorithm</li>
  <li>Get syntax highlighting for the source code</li>
  <li>Add your own Python algorithm to the already available library of algorithms<br>
  </li>
  <li>Manage your algorithms in the library<br>
  </li>
</ul>
